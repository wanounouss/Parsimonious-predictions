# Parsimonious-predictions
Are predictions made using averaged models accurate? 
Do we need a good mechanistic understanding of the generating model to make accurate predictions?

I here look at the predictive accuracy of averaged models using AIC model-averaging relative to other models selected via machine learning techniques.
